======
[Live Website](https://hankc97.github.io/Angered-Birdy/)

### Features
------
* Each Object on the canvas has their own real-life physical properties such as mass, velocity, friction, gravity, torque. NO PREBUILT GAME ENGINE.
* Each Object has properties of collision such as bird on pig and bird on block detection.
* Ability to create a stage with ease. Every object has adjustable properties so positioning them or changing their shape can be done with a simple key value pair relationship.
* Ability to reset and increase stages of all entities when the round is won or loss.
* Dynamic Bird Launching, as any object can be launched from the sling shot and the magnitude/angle of launch can be adjusted for a further or shorter shot.
* Use Local Storage to store current and previous best highscore inside the client browser. 
* Implemented Timer Animations as each object has state.

### Background
------
Angered Birds is a Projectile and Destruction game that includes real time physics and levels. Every level includes a preloaded world where an object is fired from a static point to destroy the enemy objects to gain points and stars. 
--This project was built in 2 weeks with no prebuilt game engine

## Launching with Bird Collision and Physical Properties
The Bird can be adjusted based off the pull for its magnitude and angle. The further it pulled back the further the bird will go based off the magnitude. 
Once the bird collides with the bird, it will gain points and cause the pig to enter a "dead" state which would enable the animation
